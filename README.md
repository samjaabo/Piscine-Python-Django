Chapter I

Piscine

What is a piscine?

Much like the selection piscine, the project is split in many small projects (days), and

with each day a new notion on the language/paradigm/technology you chose to work on.

Validating a piscine requires more than just a day or two of investment. We are looking

at:

• Your investment on all of theses modules: you can’t validate the piscine if you work

only on one or two projects.

• Trying to turn in every day: even if something isn’t ﬁnished, it’s better to try and

turn it in.

• At least two week of work: going into the piscine shouldn’t be taken lightly.

• After each day, you have two days to do the required peer-evaluations

## <p align="center"><strong>What is a piscine?</strong></p>

Much like the selection piscine, the project is split into many small projects (days), and with each day a new notion on the language/paradigm/technology you chose to work on. Validating a piscine requires more than just a day or two of investment. We are looking at:

- Your investment on all of these modules: you can’t validate the piscine if you work only on one or two projects.
- Trying to turn in every day: even if something isn’t finished, it’s better to try and turn it in.
- At least two weeks of work: going into the piscine shouldn’t be taken lightly.
- After each day, you have two days to do the required peer-evaluations.
